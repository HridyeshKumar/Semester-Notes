The GMM-UBM Mean Interval (GUMI) kernel is a concept used in the field of speaker recognition. The exact formula for the GUMI kernel is not provided in the search results, but it is derived based on the Bhattacharyya distance.


The GUMI kernel allows us to exploit the speaker's information not only from the mean vectors of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) but also from the covariance matrices. This approach is seen as an improvement over conventional methods like the Kullback-Leibler (KL) kernel in GMM-supervector SVM classifier, which limits the adaptation of GMM to mean value and leaves covariance unchanged.


The introduction of the GUMI concept leads to a new kernel for the SVM classifier. The effectiveness of the new kernel has been demonstrated on the 2006 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) dataset.


In terms of application, the GUMI kernel is used in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for speaker recognition. It is particularly effective in text-independent speaker recognition, where the speaker's voice is characterized by the GMM parameters such as the mean vectors, covariance matrices, and mixture weights. The GUMI kernel allows us to exploit the speaker's information not only from the mean vectors of GMM but also from the covariance matrices. This makes it a powerful tool for speaker recognition systems.
