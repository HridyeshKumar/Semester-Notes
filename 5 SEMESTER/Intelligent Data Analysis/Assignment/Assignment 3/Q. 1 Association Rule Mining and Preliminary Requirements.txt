1. Explain association rule mining and list all the preliminary requirements for it.


Solution:


Association Rule Mining uncovers relationships between sets of items in datasets, revealing patterns and correlations. 
Rules, expressed as Antecedent -> Consequent, describe dependencies between item sets, 
e.g., Bread -> Butter suggests a likely purchase pattern. 
Evaluation metrics like lift, support, and confidence gauge rule importance. 

Basic terminologies include Itemset, Support Count, and Minimum Support Count.

- **Itemset:** Collection of one or more items in the transaction dataset.

- **Support Count of an Itemset:** Frequency of an item in the transaction data.

- **Minimum Support Count:** Threshold for an itemset's frequency to be relevant in association mining.

Preliminary requirements:

1. **Data:** Transaction dataset or database for identifying item associations.

2. **Support and Confidence:** Metrics evaluating rule quality; support denotes the if/then relationship frequency, while confidence indicates the truthfulness of these relationships.

3. **Minimum Support and Minimum Confidence:** Thresholds to extract association rules effectively.

4. **Algorithm:** APRIORI and FP-GROWTH algorithms are commonly employed for rule extraction.

5. **Non-Numeric, Categorical Data:** Association rule mining is well-suited for non-numeric, categorical datasets.

Support and confidence are key metrics in association rule mining, applied to datasets for pattern discovery.

Support quantifies the frequency of an itemset in the dataset. 

The formula is Support(X) = (Transactions with X) / (Total transactions)
 


Confidence measures the likelihood of item Y given item X, 

calculated as Confidence(X -> Y) = (Support(X âˆª Y)) / (Support(X)) 

These metrics, often used together, help uncover common patterns and the strength of associations in large datasets.


Association rule mining is a valuable analytical tool, applied in diverse domains such as data mining and continuous production. Despite its advantages, it has limitations like any other technique.
