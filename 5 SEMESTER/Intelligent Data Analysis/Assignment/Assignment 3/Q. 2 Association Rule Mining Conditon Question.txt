2. For each of the following questions, provide an example of an association rule from the 
market basket domain that satisfies the following conditions. Also, describe whether such 
rules are subjectively interesting. (4M)
a. A rule that has high support and high confidence.
b. A rule that has reasonably high support but low confidence.
c. A rule that has low support and low confidence.
d. A rule that has low support and high confidence


Solution:


a. A rule that has high support and high confidence:

   Example: {Bread} -> {Butter}

   Explanation: This rule indicates a strong association, revealing that customers purchasing bread are likely to also buy butter. This insight can aid supermarket strategies like product placement, promotions, and inventory management.


b. A rule that has reasonably high support but low confidence:

   Example: {Eggs} -> {Milk}

   Explanation: While there's decent support, the low confidence suggests that not all egg buyers also purchase milk. This rule may not be as impactful for decision-making regarding product placement or promotions.


c. A rule that has low support and low confidence:

   Example: {Caviar} -> {Champagne}

   Explanation: This rule suggests a rare purchasing pattern with both low support and low confidence. It lacks significance for decision-making in the supermarket due to its infrequency and weak association.


d. A rule that has low support and high confidence:

   Example: {Diapers} -> {Baby Food}

   Explanation: Despite low support, the high confidence implies a strong link between diaper and baby food purchases. This rule could be valuable for targeted strategies, even with a smaller customer base.
