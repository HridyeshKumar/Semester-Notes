Mathematical Formulation for Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):

Variables:

A = Alice
B = Bob
C = Charlie
D = David
E = Emily
F = Fiona
Domain:

Seats around the circular table (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Constraints:

A and B must sit next to each other: A + 1 = B or B + 1 = A
C and D must sit at opposite ends of the table: (C = 1 and D = 6) or (C = 6 and D = 1)
E and F must not sit next to each other: |E - F| > 1, where E and F are not adjacent seats.
Solution using Backtracking:

Initialize an empty seating arrangement.
Start with Alice and Bob sitting next to each other (constraint 1).
Place Charlie and David at opposite ends of the table (constraint 2).
Place Emily and Fiona in remaining seats, making sure they are not next to each other (constraint 3).
If all constraints are satisfied, return the seating arrangement. Otherwise, backtrack and try different arrangements until a valid solution is found.
Solution using Forward Propagation:

Initialize an empty seating arrangement.
Start with Alice and Bob sitting next to each other (constraint 1).
Place Charlie and David at opposite ends of the table (constraint 2).
Use forward propagation to propagate the constraints and eliminate invalid options for Emily and Fiona's seats.
Place Emily and Fiona in remaining valid seats.
If a valid solution is found, return the seating arrangement. Otherwise, backtrack and try different arrangements until a valid solution is found.
Solution using Genetic Algorithm with Single Point Crossover:

Generate an initial population of seating arrangements randomly.
Evaluate the fitness of each arrangement by checking if all constraints are satisfied.
Select top-performing arrangements based on their fitness for crossover.
Perform single point crossover to create offspring arrangements.
Mutate some of the offspring arrangements to introduce genetic diversity.
Evaluate the fitness of offspring arrangements.
Replace some of the weakest arrangements in the population with offspring arrangements.
Repeat steps 3-7 for a certain number of generations or until a valid solution is found.
Return the seating arrangement that satisfies all constraints.
