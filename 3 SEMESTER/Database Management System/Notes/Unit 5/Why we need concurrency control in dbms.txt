why we need concurrency control in dbms?
Why use Concurrency method?
Reasons for using Concurrency control method is DBMS:

->To apply Isolation through mutual exclusion between conflicting transactions
->To resolve read-write and write-write conflict issues
->To preserve database consistency through constantly preserving execution obstructions
->The system needs to control the interaction among the concurrent transactions.
This control is achieved using concurrent-control schemes.
->Concurrency control helps to ensure serializability.
