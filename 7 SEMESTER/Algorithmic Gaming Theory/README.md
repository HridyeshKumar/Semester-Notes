## Introduction

Algorithmic Game Theory combines game theory and algorithm design to solve real-world strategic decision problems. This repository, built on the **NPTEL Algorithmic Game Theory** course, contains:

- Weekly assignments (PDF format)
- Cleaned and cropped lecture notes (PDF format)
- Transcripts for all lectures (PDF format)
- The official course book

**Note**: All weekly notes have been cleaned and cropped by me, while the assignments, transcripts, and other lecture notes are sourced from the NPTEL course.
